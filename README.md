# NewsFocus

This app scrapes the article headlines from various news sites and presents the top 10 most used words for each site in a readable format.

### TODO:
Implement MySQL usage for storage of count histories

Implement React for a better userface to browse through counts

More in-depth usage of the Newspaper API (allow for user to view article top words came from, expand on count presentation by combining news sites, etc.)
